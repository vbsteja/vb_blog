### Blackboard Technology

**Overview**: A blackboard architecture has three major components:
* a hierarchically organized global memory or database called a blackboard which saves the solutions generated by the knowledge sources;
* a collection of knowledge sources that generate independent solutions on the blackboard using expert systems, neural networks, and numerical analysis;
* a separate control module or scheduler which reviews the knowledge sources and selects the most appropriate one.

The advantages of a blackboard include separation of knowledge into independent modules with each module being free to use the appropriate technology to arrive at the best solution with the most efficiency. An additional advantage of the independent modules is the potential for using separate computing units for the independent knowledge sources, thus allowing distributed computing. This approach allows for rapid prototyping of complex problems and simplifies long-term system maintenance.
