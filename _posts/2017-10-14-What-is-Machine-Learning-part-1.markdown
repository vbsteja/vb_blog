# Introduction to Machine Learning.

in this post i will help you and myself better understanding about what is it all  about **Machine Learning**.why every one is so talking as if it is the new Electricity, and why is it so important?.

Machine Learning is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence**. In general what is meant by AI(Artificial Intelligence, will use this a lot), the ability to replicate an intelligent behavior which we humans only can boast of on the planet earth, other than a lot of Animals,Birds who can posses a limited intelligent behavior. but the real question is can the machines be really smart as humans? we have to wait and see for that.there are evidence that a machine can match the human if not better in certain tasks, be it playing chess,go or recognizing the pictures of animals, writing [poetry](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/03/road-not-taken-computer-generated-poetry/)(IBM Watson has done that).they are learning, eventually with the recent advancements in the Quantum Computing they may reach a point where they could replicate the intelligent behavior.though AI has its flaws , a lot of people  most notably Tesla's CEO has claimed the Raise of AI could lead to an Apocalypse. there are recent incidents like the one in Facebook labs , the AI bots started creating their own language and started communicating.there is a lot to hope amid all these things, AI can lead to a better life of Human Beings, or it can end it for once and all.we can only wait and watch.

Okay, now back to our original goal of this post describing what is Machine Learning. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. how exactly machines are going to be learning from experience with out explicit programming, so you may wonder we may need not to program machines for this process, no! wait there, in computer terms we have to program the Machine to do the learning from experience.there is a technical gap between what people usually thought about what is ML and what it actually is. there is some math going under the hoods, of course we have a lot of ML libraries to wrap the math for us and provided the higher level API just even a new guy to programming can use if he/she has the complete understanding of the ML problem they are solving.so what kind of problems ML could solve?. you can solve various problems include classification, regression, clustering problems. going forward we will learn about each of the problem kind which ML can solve.

**Machine Learning Types**:

Machine Learning can be divided into the following categories.

* supervised learning.
* unsupervised learning.
* semi supervised learning.
* reinforcement learning.

Machine learning can solve problems of various types from fraud detection in credit cards to predicting election polls, from image processing to natural language processing, from speech recognition to text generation. Machine Learning can boost the Data Science field by getting better insights from the data. 

**Software to do Machine Learning**:

The popular programming languages for machine learning are Python, R, Scala(Spark). My preferred language to do machine learning is Python since it is opensource and easier to program ML concepts in Python and a ton's of open source libraries available to do pretty much anything in python. Following are some best curated list of libraries available for machine learning in python.

scientific python Libraries:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy
* Matplotlib(for plotting)

scientific Python Libraries are very useful to preprocess the data and prepare datast for ML models. ideally you would want to represent the data in numpy arrays as they are very fast and memory efficient. The popular ML libraries like Tensorflow and scikit learn operates on top of numpy arrays. pandas is a data analysis toolkit, which again operates on top of numpy arrays for heavy numerical lifting to perform the analysis.

ML Libraries:
	
* Tensorflow
* Scikit-learn

Tensorflow is probably the most used ML library by academics, researchers and in production by big guns in the corporate world in the last couple of years. scikit learn is the most popular another ML library which is around for a long time, and is the number one ML library in Python being used before tensorflow arrival. 

in the following series of posts we will mostly discuss about the first 3 types of ML categories, becuase Reinforcement is an altogether big and much evolving field , we will talk about it in a separate series of posts.
in the next post i will show you different types of problems in the categories mentioned above and how to solve them.
